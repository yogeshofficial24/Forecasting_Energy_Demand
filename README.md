# Electricity Consumption Prediction App

This is a Streamlit app for predicting electricity consumption and visualizing actual vs. predicted values for different states.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
1.Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yogeshofficial24/Forecasting_Energy_Demand.git
```
2.Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd Forecasting_Energy_Demand
```
3.Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data Preparation
1.Ensure you have the dataset named dataset.csv in the project directory.

2.The dataset should include columns for date, energy consumption for different states, and other relevant features.

## Model Training
1.Run the Jupyter Notebook main.ipynb to train the machine learning models for energy demand prediction.

2.The notebook includes data preprocessing, model selection (Random Forest Regressor), hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV, and evaluation metrics calculation.

## Streamlit Web Application
1.Run the Streamlit app to interactively predict energy consumption for selected states and dates.

2.Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

3.Execute the following command:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
This will open a browser window with the Streamlit app interface.

## Usage
1.Select the state for which you want to predict energy consumption from the dropdown menu.

2.Choose a date using the date input box.

3.Click the "Predict" button to see the predicted energy consumption for the selected state and date.
